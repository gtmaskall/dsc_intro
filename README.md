# Springboard data science taster course notebooks

## worked_notebooks
Contain the worked example notebooks that include completed code.

## source_notebooks
These are sourced from worked_notebooks but have had the assignment
code deleted and output cleared.
Students will load these notebooks and work from them. They can, if
and when they choose, refer to the original notebooks in worked_notebooks
to check their answers or get unstuck.

# About me
Hi, I'm Guy. I'm a mentor with Springboard and really hope you find this taste
of learning data scientist is something you'd like more of. If you have any
questions, or are thinking of signing up to take things further with
Springboard's full courses, then drop me a line. I'll be happy to help.
