    "You've now seen how pandas holds tabular data, where each column can be a different type (e.g. sex is character and age is a number). Furthermore, pandas provides incredibly powerful methods for slicing and dicing the data to answer some very interesting questions using relatively little code. You're well on your journey to becoming a data ninja!"
